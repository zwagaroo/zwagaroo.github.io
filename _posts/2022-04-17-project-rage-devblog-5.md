Here is the breakdown of my work on Project Rage from 4/03/2022 to 4/17/2022.

# Creating Heavy Enemy Charge and Dash (3 hours)

The first thing I done in these two weeks was work on the Heavy Enemy Charge and Dash. The heavy enemy has an attack pattern of charging up, blinking yellow while it does so, and then charging at the player dealing damage and knocking them down. For the charge up, I thought that a sound involving an machining winding up would sound great so I created that within ableton using various synths (1 hour). Another part that I thought would be very great to include is a bouncing sweep which got faster and faster for the windup (30 minutes). I pieced them together and added various audio effects for them to blend seamlessly. Then I had to include the dash portion which I didn't know what I should include. So I listened to various dash sound effects from a lot of different games such as from [sonic 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKYaZAyldt4) and from [pokemon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WezNiF3O8EM). I realized that dash should sound more energetic in the beginning and less so in the end. I had to then figure out what a machine dashing on concrete might sound like. I knew it was going to have to be very gritty, and as I experiemnted I realized that high hats combined with noise then slowed down to a large degree will get the sound that I like. The dash took me around 1 hour 30 minutes. Here is the final [Heavy Enemy Charge and Dash Sfx](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KKlilS2iNmxQbzDYbDSGJMdQ8SqmkP7A/view).

# Reiterating Elevator Sound Effects (2 hours)

After getting feedback from design that the elevator sounds were a bit too reverberant I decided to redo the elevator sounds from the ground up. The audio lead, Morgan, told me that I should aim for something more mechanical and futuristic. I set out to try to do so. At first I didn't really understand what he meant by that. But I assumed he meant that the sound of the elevators opening and closing should sound like motors like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-9WTKJWH50) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-9WTKJWH50) but maybe longer. So I set out with a synth to create that sort of sound. I combined multiple sine wave synths and put a lot of audio effects on them and eventually after quite a long time I was able to get a sound that I wanted. I added some more things like elevator bells and elevator's shutting sound to make it a bit more realistic. This whole process took around 2 hours. Here is the final [Elevator Opening](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YT2855A4tXenWBzK6mpN_SC_kCNwrdmF/view) and [Elevator Closing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Ji8ZK_u_uNuaxdq3O2GFTDxuIIMMH0M/view) sound effects.

# Reiterating Results-Victory Screen Music (3 hours)

Morgan also told me the guitar wasn't rendering properly and I had to redo the guitar parts almost completely which took around 1 hour 30 minutes. When I was trying to get the rendered stems to Morgan, I realized that the sound for this piece was a bit boring and too repetitive. Thus, I changed up a lot of the audio and created some more interesting melodies in the guitar portion. I added another guitar to provide some more interesting background sounds and changed up some of the rhythmns in the drums. This process took around another 1 hour 30 minutes. At the end I renedered it as stems and sent it to Morgan and he told me that it was great.

# Floating Sign Ambience (2 hours)
