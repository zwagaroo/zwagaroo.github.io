Here is the breakdown of my work on Project Rage from 3/20/2022 to 4/03/2022.

# Creating Game Over Jingle (4 hours)

This week I worked on the Game Over Jingle for when the player has has died/lost the game. As a reference I listened many of different game over screen music such as for games like [Undertale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S21ZSsC21U) and [Metal Gear Solid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHr3ag7B410), and many others (1 hour). I then realized that the game over screen needed to be somewhat somber. I thought of a descending and somber melody and I created it in Ableton Live (3 hours), using fairly airy synths to set the mood. At first I added just the base layer of melody, but I realized that it was probably not enough because it sounded just too empty. So I added some constrasting call and response elements with a keyboard synth. I then also added some high hats to keep the beat. Here is the finished [Game Over Jingle](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1DNivrdFpNfrRVDn0KE19OdnHwLI_jBI8)
