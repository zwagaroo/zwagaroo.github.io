Here is the breakdown of my work on Project Rage from 2/20/2022 to 3/6/2022. This week my main assignment was the level 1 downtown music.

## Level 1 Downtown Music (25 hours)

### Experimentation (5 Hours)

In order to get the correct vibes for a cyberpunk world. I listened to a lot of heavy electronic music (3 hours). Some of the things I listened to includes playists such as [Monstercat Uncaged Vol. 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7IXDfisStA&t=5476s) and [Cyberpunk based Synthwave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2ECgOhoDGs&t=6628s). I also started reading a lot of cyberpunk media such as graphic novels like Transmetropolitan and The Surrogates and looking at a lot of art to get a better feeling of the world we are trying to design. From this I started to think about many of the sounds that may appear in a cyberpunk city full of neon lights and the feelings that are invoked in this sort of environment.
