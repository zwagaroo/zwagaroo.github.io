Here is the breakdown of my work on Project Rage from 2/20/2022 to 3/6/2022. This week my main assignment was the level 1 downtown music.

## Level 1 Downtown Music (25 hours)

### Experimentation (5 Hours)

In order to get the correct vibes for a cyberpunk world. I listened to a lot of heavy electronic music (3 hours). Some of the things I listened to includes playists such as [Monstercat Uncaged Vol. 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7IXDfisStA&t=5476s) and [Cyberpunk based Synthwave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2ECgOhoDGs&t=6628s). I also started reading a lot of cyberpunk media such as graphic novels like Transmetropolitan and The Surrogates and looking at a lot of art to get a better feeling of the world we are trying to design.

From this I started to think about many of the sounds that may appear in such a cyberpunk city full of neon lights and chaos. I thought about the feelings that are invoked in this sort of environment. I was able to create and find sounds that are robotic and heavily modulated and processed to make it sound very futuristic (2 hours). 

### Creating the Song (20 hours)

I started out by making a draft which I intially thought was pretty good (5 hours). During the creation of the melody I thought that the music was supposed to be somewhat more more relaxed as the it wasn't supposed to be a boss fight or anything. So I built a melody and added a bunch of audio effects like equilizer, pitch bends, autopan and compression. Then I added the harmonies and bases. Which I thought was really great, until I looked at the audio guidelines again. I realized that we wanted rage filled music the whole way through and the focus should be on the rythmn instead.

I started over. I started by working on the ambience and drums and the intro to setup the song. This time I considered more about the differences
