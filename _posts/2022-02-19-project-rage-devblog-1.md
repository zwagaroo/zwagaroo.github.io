## Introduction

Welcome to my first blog post for this semester's WolverineSoft project: Rage. The current idea for rage is a beat'em up set in a cyberpunk setting. This semester I am working on the audio team to design sounds and music for the game. Currently we are still in the process of learning the tools to implement audio into the game such as Wwise and generating music and sfx ideas through sonic palettes and music snippets.

## Generating Ideas (17 hours)

### Sonic Palettes (4 hours)

Created a sonic palette to try to capture the sound of cyberpunk. Brought together many of pieces in media that I thought was a good representation such as music from Tron: Legacy and Before the Night by Home.

### Music Snippets (13 hours)

Looked at all the sonic palettes generated by the audio team to get a good idea of what type of music and sfx are included. Though there was some great examples, I thought that wasn't enough to give me a really great idea of what cyberpunk should sound like. I was able to search on youtube for a lot of cyberpunk themed music and found a couple great mixes like [this mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JqKRqOmzi0) and [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcOhAodaW5Y&list=PLcx8DGkalsx4JPyF7VmDIOg1rzLR-suB4). I listened and tried to experiment how to make the swells, sweeping synths, and fast modulation that are in so many of those pieces. Took around 4 hours in total for listening and experimentation.

ThenI 


```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
